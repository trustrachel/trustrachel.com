		<p>I got my grubby mitts on some food-grade  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smooth-on.com/">silicone RTV</a>, and I’ve been dying to try it out.  I scoured the house for something tiny yet cute to cast, and Carcassonne meeples seemed just the thing.  This is the fully cured mold, just before I removed all the meeples.</p>
<p>The first batch of meeple truffles will be some concoction of Ghiradelli chocolate, pistachios and dried fruit, all of which is in the cupboard <em>right now</em>.  Although tinted white chocolate would be adorable, am I right? Or homemade jolly rancher meeples.  Or gummi meeples.</p>

<p>The possibilities are <em>endless</em>.</p></body></html>
