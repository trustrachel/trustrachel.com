<p>Speaking of crazy stuff we’ve made vaguely recently, here’s some etched wine glasses we did for Christmas using the laser cutter at Techshop. Each one is etched with a little icon so you can remember which one’s yours. They were a HUGE hit.</p>
<p>We did a set for friends with hand grenades, ninja stars, tanks, shoes, a handbag, cherries, etc., but the ones in the picture are our set.  Since I’m an ex-astrophysicist, I requested the astronomical symbols for the planets.  Front to back you have Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon and Earth.</p></body></html>
