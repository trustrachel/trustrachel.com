<html><body><p>Crazy Crap We’ve Made Vaguely Recently Week continues, with our wedding invitations. I love showing them off (to a rather scary degree) since I think they turned out awesome.</p>
<p>Like the glassware, we also made ‘em on the laser cutter. </p>

<p>The edging is all laser-cut. We were trying for wood bark but it turned out more abstract. I like it: </p>

<p>If you turn the invitation over, this is the only thing on the back. I think that’s all you need.</p>

<p><span>The inside. It’s an oak tree (a coast live oak, ubiquitous in this area) and leaves, drawn by my husband.</span></p>

<p><span>Detail of the oak leaves. I really liked those oak leaves, we used them as motifs on everything. Note the scorching from the laser on the edges, which I think is a neat effect and makes it look more organic. </span></p>

<p>Once we got a design down, it didn’t take too long to power through them all. Especially since our wedding was fairly small.  It took a couple days to nail down a design, four hours to cut them all, one afternoon to spray glue them together and one afternoon to assemble and mail them.  They were a big hit.</p>

<p>It was the only really insanely crafty thing we did for the wedding, I promise. </p></body></html>
