		<p>The first batch of meeple truffles emerges!  As I was afraid of, the meeples were difficult to unmold and tended to crack. But a chosen few made it out. (If you look close, you can see the wood grain lines from the original.  Silicone picks up an <em>insane</em> level of detail.)</p>
<p>IMHO, traditional truffles are way too sweet, too bland and too rich, so these are a mixture of ganache, pecans, dried cranberries and sea salt.  Making a note: huge success.  Sweet + tart + savory + chocolate + salt = holy cow yes.   ( Just like those old lady <a title="Whitman's Samplers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitman%27s" target="_blank">Whitman’s Samplers</a>, only without the suck.)</p>

<p>These were made by brushing chocolate into the mold, but I’m thinking it’ll be easier and much, much quicker to mold the meeple guts and then pour chocolate over.</p></body></html>
