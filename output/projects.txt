Here's where you can find my work on the web.

Flask-FeatureFlags
==================

[Find it at Github](https://github.com/trustrachel/Flask-FeatureFlags)

My first open source project. I work on a large Flask app and we needed a way to disable features in production until they were ready to ship. This plugin lets you enable or disable features based on configuration.

It's all my work, start to finish, although it was heavily inspired by [Gargoyle](https://github.com/disqus/gargoyle). 

It's used several projects at LinkedIn, including our app.

Coming up
=========
As of July 2013, I'm working on factoring out more of our production application into open source projects. Hopefully the next one will be released by August.
