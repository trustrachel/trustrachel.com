		<p>StarCraft has widowed me these last couple nights, so I’ve had time to putter around in the kitchen to the soothing sounds of “Zerg wave inbound” and “You need more minerals” and the ever-popular “Your base is under attack.”</p>
<p>I bookmarked this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/dining/15appe.html?ref=dining">NYT granola</a> recipe ages ago, and oh my goodness.  It is tasty.  Well…my version of it is, at least, I tweaked it quite a bit.  (I like sugar as much as the next girl, but seriously. 1:1 sugar-to-nut ratio is <em>a bit high</em>.) The olive oil gives it a lovely flavor, not at all bitter like you’d think.</p>

<p><strong>Sanders Clan Brand Granola</strong></p>

<p>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats<br>1 cup raw pecans, chopped not too finely<br>1/2 cup almonds, chopped not too finely<br>1/4 cup sunflower seeds<br>1/4 cup packed brown sugar<br>1/4 cup pure maple syrup<br>couple squeezes of honey (maybe a tablespoon or two? didn’t really measure)<br>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>1 teaspoon kosher salt (I added another 1/2 teaspoon, but I like salt)<br>3/4 cup chopped dried mixed berries <br>1/4 cup chopped dried Turkish apricots</p>

<p>Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Mix all ingredients EXCEPT THE FRUIT* together in a large bowl.</p>

<p>Spread mixture on a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer and bake for  40-45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown and well  toasted.</p>

<p>After it cools for 5 minutes or so, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the fruit.</p>

<p>Goes well with yogurt and fresh fruit. Or just plain out of the bowl is good too.</p>

<p>* Seriously, picking chopped fruit out because you misread the recipe bites.</p></body></html>
