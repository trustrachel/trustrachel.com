        <div class="content">
            <p></p><p></p><p>Crazy Crap We’ve Made Vaguely Recently Week continues, with our wedding invitations. I love showing them off (to a rather scary degree) since I think they turned out awesome.</p>
<p>Like the glassware, we also made ‘em on the laser cutter. </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/articles/1front.jpg" alt="You have no idea how long it took to learn to tie a flat knot correctly. Seriously." width="800"></p>

<p>The edging is all laser-cut. We were trying for wood bark but it turned out more abstract. I like it: </p>

<p>Detail of one of the monograms: </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/articles/4monogram.jpg" alt="I forget which font this is, but it's pretty." width="800"></p>

<p>If you turn the invitation over, this is the only thing on the back. I think that’s all you need.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/articles/2back.jpg" alt="Friggin LASERS" width="800"></p>

<p><span>The inside. It’s an oak tree (a coast live oak, ubiquitous in this area) and leaves, drawn by my husband.</span></p>

<p>[missing image]</p>
<p><span>Detail of the oak leaves. I really liked those oak leaves, we used them as motifs on everything. Note the scorching from the laser on the edges, which I think is a neat effect and makes it look more organic. </span></p>

<p><span><img src="assets/images/articles/6insidedetail.jpg" alt="Purty." width="800"></span></p>

<p>Once we got a design down, it didn’t take too long to power through them all. Especially since our wedding was fairly small.  It took a couple days to nail down a design, four hours to cut them all, one afternoon to spray glue them together and one afternoon to assemble and mail them.  They were a big hit.</p>

<p>It was the only really insanely crafty thing we did for the wedding, I promise. </p>

This was our final project for ME 106 (Mechatronics): an autonomous blimp drone that was designed to be self-powered and avoid obstacles.</p>
<p>This video is our first test flight, and after the demo we had a little fun <a title="FLY MY PRETTY FLY" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Edyekptqw" target="_blank">running down the batteries</a>.  (Please excuse the coughing, I’d caught a horrible cold right in time for the final project demo and was hopped up on tons of cough syrup.)  </p>
<p>We got our inspiration from the <a title="Blimpduino" href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A44817" target="_blank">Blimpduino </a>project, an open-source autonomous blimp drone powered by an Arduino, but this is our own engine design and our own code.  If you’re bored, feel free to read our <a title="Blimptastic!" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BT-Xers0qEtdb9xvZu886dAwwylwTDWi-5eghLBQ8FA/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJma4uoC" target="_blank">term project writeup</a>.</p>

<p>We had a number of last minute disasters with this project.  You’ll notice the um, creative use of balloons? Due to cost (helium is expensive, yo) we could only fill the blimp the day before the project was due. Naturally we discovered we’d vastly overestimated how much lift we’d have.  Instead of one RC blimp balloon….well, you see what we had to frantically tape together to get the thing to work.</p>

<p>The other big disaster was we originally had two sensing systems on board: an IR sensor to detect the ceiling (to maintain level flight), and a ultrasonic sensor for range-finding. Except my partner accidentally broke the ultrasonic sensor three days before and we couldn’t get a replacement in time.  IR has a much shorter range than ultrasonic does (80 cm vs 12m!) so our blimp got really myopic. Also it meant we had to scrap all altitude control which made flight really unstable.</p>

<p>However, we powered through and got the damn thing to fly, which I’m pretty proud of.  This was a really fun project, I loved it. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p></p><p></p><p>I’d like to introduce you to the patron saint of cooking science:</p>
<p><img alt="Harold McGee" src="assets/images/articles/haroldmcgee.jpg" width="210" height="251"></p>
<p>This be-bearded man is Harold McGee, and he wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Science-Lore-Kitchen/dp/0684800012/" target="_blank">On Food and Cooking</a>.  This book is awesome.  It reads like a really good textbook, and while that <em>sounds</em> like damning with faint praise, it’s not.  A good textbook is easy to follow, full of useful information, and readable.  He packs an amazing amount of information in this book.  Why is bread chewy? Page 290.  Why is beef red and fish white? Page 92.  Farting astronauts?  Page 257. *</p>

<p>This book didn’t make me a cook, it made me a better one.  Knowing what I’m doing and more importantly, <em>why </em>I’m doing it lets me to replicate results exactly, and if I need to make changes, I know what effect the changes will have. </p>

<p>Knowing the physiology of taste and smell also helps me cook.   The traditional five tastes are: sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and umami  (savory).  An interesting meal balances all of these flavors.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the secret weapon.  Have you ever tasted a dish and thought, <em>this needs something</em>, but you don’t know what?  It probably needs more sour.  Or if you want a nicer word, “brightness”. </p>

<p>Anything acidic will add brightness - I’ll usually reach for dijon mustard or lemon juice, but today’s secret weapon is balsamic vinegar.</p>

<p>This recipe really highlights acidity.  It goes from flat and boring to amazing with a tablespoon of vinegar.  For reals, yo. </p>

<p><strong>Corn, Tomato, and Zucchini Soup with Basil</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty much the only recipe I make from Mark Bittman’s <em>How to Cook Everything</em>. Half the reason for doing this post is to record the recipe, as the page it’s on is falling out and I’m afraid I’ll lose it.</p>

<ul><li>4 cups chicken stock</li>

<li>4 ears fresh corn</li>

<li>2 tablespoons butter or olive oil</li>

<li>1 medium onion, minced</li>

<li>2 cups cored, peeled, seeded and chopped tomatos (I’m too lazy for this and use Muir Glen diced, it’s fine)</li>

<li>1 medium zucchini (about half a pound), diced</li>

<li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

<li>salt and pepper</li>

<li>1/2 cup fresh basil, minced</li>

<li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (I’m pretty sure I use a tablespoon)</li>

</ul><p>Heat the stock in a large, deep saucepan.  Strip the kernels from the corn and add the cobs to the stock (break them in half if necessary);  let them simmer while you prep the other veggies.</p>

<p>Heat the butter or oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatos, zucchini, garlic, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes.  (Don’t let the zucchini turn to mush, you want it soft but with texture.)</p>

<p>Remove the corn cobs from the stock and add the veggies to the stock.  Cook until the zucchini is fully done (tender but not mushy), about 5 minutes.  Add the corn kernels and basil. </p>

<p>ADD THE VINEGAR. BE AMAZED AT THE DIFFERENCE. Adjust seasoning as necessary.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>* It’s part of a discussion on why beans cause flatulence.  We know a lot about flatulence because of the space program, because it was feared that a really farty astronaut could asphyxiate himself.  Yes.  To win the Cold War, we had to study farts.</p>

<p>This time I wanted easy and lazy.  Making <a title="meeple truffles" href="http://trustrachel.com/post/898540194/the-first-batch-of-meeple-truffles-emerges-as-i" target="_blank">meeple truffles</a> was fun, but it was, you know, <em>work</em>. This recipe promised it was just Koolaid + gelatin + water + pour + set.  Easy! No muss, no fuss.</p>

<p>Yeeeeaaah…not so much.  They’re cute, but taste like slightly flavored rubber.  The silicone mold would be better eats.  Oh well, it serves me right for being lazy and not making real jelly candy.</p>

<p>(At least they bounce nicely when you pitch them at the floor. )</p>

<p>I’m in the Reconstruction era now, which is a sad and nasty time of social unrest and political infighting.  It’s worth a listen, though:  America was begun in 1776, but the country we know today was built in the 1860s.</p>
<p>This is a five minute clip from one of the lectures. There aren’t many amusing stories from this time, but this particular one manages to be hilarious and terribly moving.  A former master writes to his former slave, and asks him to come back.  This is the former’s slave’s reply. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p></p><p></p><p><img src="assets/images/articles/tumblr_l6nsyxBQB21qzjuyp.jpg"></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know what you’re thinking.  “Ew, anchovies! Why would I want to put stuff that smells like catfood in MY food?”  Well shut it, Sparky, because this stuff is awesome. </p>
<p>Properly applied, anchovy paste does <em>not</em> make everything taste like fish.  Let’s get that out of the way.  It makes everything taste <em>better</em>.  If done right, it gives food this rich, savory background flavor that is delicious, yet impossible to identify.  The trick is to use it wisely, grasshopper.</p>

<p>The first rule of anchovy paste: don’t use much anchovy paste.  This stuff is nuclear. Add a teaspoon at a time until you’re happy with it.</p>

<p>The second rule of anchovy paste: don’t use much anchovy paste.  Seriously. </p>

<p>The third rule of anchovy paste:  cook it.  Raw anchovy paste is not a good thing.   Treat it like garlic.  In fact, adding it with the garlic is a good rule of thumb.  If the dish takes garlic, anchovy paste will make it better.</p>

<p>My very favorite application of anchovy paste is a Italian sauce. It’s great by itself on pasta, but broccoli, green beans, snow peas, zucchini or any other sautéable vegetable works too.</p>

<p><strong>Sanders Clan Brand Make Stuff Taste Good Sauce<br></strong></p>

<ul><li>olive oil, couple tablespoons or so</li>

<li>half a onion, finely diced</li>

<li>2-4 cloves of garlic, depending on how much you like garlic</li>

<li>anchovy paste, to taste (I usually add about a tablespoon)</li>

<li>red pepper flakes, to taste (I usually add about a half a teaspoon)</li>

</ul><p>The amounts are rough guidelines, it’s mostly to taste.  Heat the olive oil over medium to medium-high heat, add the diced onion and stir around until softened (3-5 min).  Add the garlic, anchovy paste and red pepper and stir around for about 30 seconds, or until fragrant. </p>

<p>For my favorite lazy meal, at this point I’d add broccoli florets and toss around until the broccoli is tender.  Then add cooked pasta (I like the spiral rotini), toss around to coat, and add some grated parm, salt and pepper.  It’s good stuff.</p>

<p>StarCraft has widowed me these last couple nights, so I’ve had time to putter around in the kitchen to the soothing sounds of “Zerg wave inbound” and “You need more minerals” and the ever-popular “Your base is under attack.”</p>

<p>I bookmarked this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/dining/15appe.html?ref=dining">NYT granola</a> recipe ages ago, and oh my goodness.  It is tasty.  Well…my version of it is, at least, I tweaked it quite a bit.  (I like sugar as much as the next girl, but seriously. 1:1 sugar-to-nut ratio is <em>a bit high</em>.) The olive oil gives it a lovely flavor, not at all bitter like you’d think.</p>

<p><strong>Sanders Clan Brand Granola</strong></p>

<p>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats<br>1 cup raw pecans, chopped not too finely<br>1/2 cup almonds, chopped not too finely<br>1/4 cup sunflower seeds<br>1/4 cup packed brown sugar<br>1/4 cup pure maple syrup<br>couple squeezes of honey (maybe a tablespoon or two? didn’t really measure)<br>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>1 teaspoon kosher salt (I added another 1/2 teaspoon, but I like salt)<br>3/4 cup chopped dried mixed berries <br>1/4 cup chopped dried Turkish apricots</p>

<p>Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Mix all ingredients EXCEPT THE FRUIT* together in a large bowl.</p>

<p>Spread mixture on a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer and bake for  40-45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown and well  toasted.</p>

<p>After it cools for 5 minutes or so, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the fruit.</p>

<p>Goes well with yogurt and fresh fruit. Or just plain out of the bowl is good too.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>* Seriously, picking chopped fruit out because you misread the recipe bites.</p>

<p>The first batch of meeple truffles emerges!  As I was afraid of, the meeples were difficult to unmold and tended to crack. But a chosen few made it out. (If you look close, you can see the wood grain lines from the original.  Silicone picks up an <em>insane</em> level of detail.)</p>

<p>IMHO, traditional truffles are way too sweet, too bland and too rich, so these are a mixture of ganache, pecans, dried cranberries and sea salt.  Making a note: huge success.  Sweet + tart + savory + chocolate + salt = holy cow yes.   ( Just like those old lady <a title="Whitman's Samplers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitman%27s" target="_blank">Whitman’s Samplers</a>, only without the suck.)</p>

<p>These were made by brushing chocolate into the mold, but I’m thinking it’ll be easier and much, much quicker to mold the meeple guts and then pour chocolate over.</p>

<p>I got my grubby mitts on some food-grade  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smooth-on.com/">silicone RTV</a>, and I’ve been dying to try it out.  I scoured the house for something tiny yet cute to cast, and Carcassonne meeples seemed just the thing.  This is the fully cured mold, just before I removed all the meeples.</p>

<p>The first batch of meeple truffles will be some concoction of Ghiradelli chocolate, pistachios and dried fruit, all of which is in the cupboard <em>right now</em>.  Although tinted white chocolate would be adorable, am I right? Or homemade jolly rancher meeples.  Or gummi meeples.</p>

<p>The possibilities are <em>endless</em>.</p>
