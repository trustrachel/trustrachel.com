Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Job is all of 2.5 miles from my house, so I figured I probably shouldn’t be a lazyass and drive. So I bought a bike. Used. Off Craigslist. Late at night from an Irish guy out of a warehouse and it was &lt;em&gt;not at all sketchy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BEHOLD. My new bike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="middle" alt="It's BEEUUUUUTIIIFULL" height="478" src="/assets/images/articles/6773160947_270116f084_z.jpg" width="640"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, okay, it’s not very impressive. “Hell of ugly” you might say. It was $80 off Craigslist. Whadda want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked fine enough for 2.5 miles over flat territory, but after riding it a few times, I noticed it had a few issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A complete lack of interest in going up to a higher gear&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If I got it in a higher gear, after a minute it’d decide it’d really rather not &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It made weird grumbly noises if I really really insisted on being in a higher gear&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I got too much of a workout riding the thing 2.5 miles over flat ground&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I mention used? Craiglist? Eighty bucks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went on Youtube, looked up “bicycle repair” and I’ve been able to fix most of the problems. I be writing this down so I remember what the hell I did, and maybe one of you will have a cheapass bike that needs fixing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Cable Tension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ipTjWnxunHI" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first videos I found was this one, on how to adjust cable tension.  Sure enough, the rear cable was hell of loose. I hand-tightened it up to where it looked OK. Shifting the rear gears worked better after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tightening the rear cable" height="500" src="/assets/images/articles/6773157383_373dc8f3a9.jpg" width="373"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Shifter Tension (?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to call this - I couldn’t find a video on it. The problem was the front shifter would not stay in a higher gear.  You ratchet it up and it would ratchet itself right back down, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there’s a screw on the shifter that was really, really loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="I screwed it good. " height="500" src="/assets/images/articles/6773160023_870db05672.jpg" width="373"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screwed it in until it was tight. That fixed it.  Yes, I am a genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front derailleur is whack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ngm6dr-1na0" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy, despite his annoying habit of telling you what to do, and then remembering the three steps you should do &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you do that thing, walks you through adjusting the low and high limits for the derailleur. This sets how high and low it shunts the chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my bike, the limit screws look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="There's a joke to be made here about high and low screwing, but this is a classy place." height="500" src="/assets/images/articles/6773158969_ccb893cb21.jpg" width="373"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, they were wildly off on my bike, and I’m still not sure I have the high limit set right.  At least I can get it into high gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brakes are whack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/njE_85TLL2Y" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I finished all that stuff up, I noticed the front brakes were really tight and one side was rubbing against the tire.  So THAT’s why I get a really nice workout riding the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light outside’s going, so I’ll probably adjust this tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
