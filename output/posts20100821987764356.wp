		<p>This time I wanted easy and lazy.  Making <a title="meeple truffles" href="http://trustrachel.com/post/898540194/the-first-batch-of-meeple-truffles-emerges-as-i" target="_blank">meeple truffles</a> was fun, but it was, you know, <em>work</em>. This recipe promised it was just Koolaid + gelatin + water + pour + set.  Easy! No muss, no fuss.</p>
<p>Yeeeeaaah…not so much.  They’re cute, but taste like slightly flavored rubber.  The silicone mold would be better eats.  Oh well, it serves me right for being lazy and not making real jelly candy.</p>

<p>(At least they bounce nicely when you pitch them at the floor. )</p></body></html>
