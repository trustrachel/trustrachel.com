<html><body><p>As many of you know, I have a NEW JOB. Hooray!</p>
<p>New Job is all of 2.5 miles from my house, so I figured I probably shouldn’t be a lazyass and drive. So I bought a bike. Used. Off Craigslist. Late at night from an Irish guy out of a warehouse and it was <em>not at all sketchy</em>.</p>

<p>BEHOLD. My new bike:</p>

<p><img align="middle" alt="It's BEEUUUUUTIIIFULL" height="478" src="http://trustrachel.com/posts/wp-content/uploads/import/6773160947_270116f084_z.jpg" width="640"></p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, okay, it’s not very impressive. “Hell of ugly” you might say. It was $80 off Craigslist. Whadda want.</p>

<p>It worked fine enough for 2.5 miles over flat territory, but after riding it a few times, I noticed it had a few issues:</p>

<ul><li>A complete lack of interest in going up to a higher gear</li>

<li>If I got it in a higher gear, after a minute it’d decide it’d really rather not </li>

<li>It made weird grumbly noises if I really really insisted on being in a higher gear</li>

<li>I got too much of a workout riding the thing 2.5 miles over flat ground</li>

</ul><p>Did I mention used? Craiglist? Eighty bucks?</p>

<p>So I went on Youtube, looked up “bicycle repair” and I’ve been able to fix most of the problems. I be writing this down so I remember what the hell I did, and maybe one of you will have a cheapass bike that needs fixing.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Cable Tension</strong></p>

<p>One of the first videos I found was this one, on how to adjust cable tension.  Sure enough, the rear cable was hell of loose. I hand-tightened it up to where it looked OK. Shifting the rear gears worked better after that.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Shifter Tension (?)</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know what to call this - I couldn’t find a video on it. The problem was the front shifter would not stay in a higher gear.  You ratchet it up and it would ratchet itself right back down, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Turns out there’s a screw on the shifter that was really, really loose.</p>

<p><img alt="I screwed it good. " height="500" src="http://trustrachel.com/posts/wp-content/uploads/import/6773160023_870db05672.jpg" width="373"></p>

<p>I screwed it in until it was tight. That fixed it.  Yes, I am a genius.</p>

<p><strong>Front derailleur is whack</strong></p>

<p>This guy, despite his annoying habit of telling you what to do, and then remembering the three steps you should do <em>before</em> you do that thing, walks you through adjusting the low and high limits for the derailleur. This sets how high and low it shunts the chain.</p>

<p>On my bike, the limit screws look like this:</p>

<p><img alt="There's a joke to be made here about high and low screwing, but this is a classy place." height="500" src="http://trustrachel.com/posts/wp-content/uploads/import/6773158969_ccb893cb21.jpg" width="373"></p>

<p>Sure enough, they were wildly off on my bike, and I’m still not sure I have the high limit set right.  At least I can get it into high gear.</p>

<p><strong>Brakes are whack</strong></p>

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/njE_85TLL2Y" width="420"></iframe></p>

<p>As I finished all that stuff up, I noticed the front brakes were really tight and one side was rubbing against the tire.  So THAT’s why I get a really nice workout riding the bike.</p>

<p>The light outside’s going, so I’ll probably adjust this tomorrow.</p>
