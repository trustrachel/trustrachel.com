<p>I’m in the Reconstruction era now, which is a sad and nasty time of social unrest and political infighting.  It’s worth a listen, though:  America was begun in 1776, but the country we know today was built in the 1860s.</p>

<p>This is a five minute clip from one of the lectures. There aren’t many amusing stories from this time, but this particular one manages to be hilarious and terribly moving.  A former master writes to his former slave, and asks him to come back.  This is the former’s slave’s reply. </p></body></html>
